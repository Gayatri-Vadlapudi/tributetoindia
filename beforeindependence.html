<p><b>During British rule</b>, India was economically exploited for the benefit of the British Empire. The British drained India's wealth by exporting raw materials at low prices and flooding the Indian market with expensive British goods, destroying local industries, especially textiles. Traditional artisans and craftsmen lost their livelihoods. Harsh land revenue systems like Zamindari forced farmers into poverty and debt. Famines became frequent due to neglect and forced grain exports. India was turned into a colonial economy, dependent on agriculture and deprived of industrial growth. British monopolies in salt, opium, and tea hurt local trade. Very little of the wealth generated in India was reinvested for public welfare. Job opportunities were minimal for Indians, especially in high positions. As a result, India emerged from colonial rule economically weak, deeply unequal, and socially affected by decades of exploitation.
Before British rule, India had a thriving handicraft and textile industry, famous worldwide. However, British policies deliberately destroyed these industries to eliminate competition with British goods. High taxes were imposed on Indian products, while British goods were imported tax-free. Indian artisans lost their jobs, and traditional skills gradually disappeared. Cities like Dhaka and Murshidabad, once known for fine textiles, declined into poverty. The economic base of India shifted from manufacturing to raw material export.

<p><b>Political History of India Before 1947</b>

India's political history before 1947 is a journey through ancient kingdoms, Islamic empires, and finally British colonial rule. The timeline of political developments reflects how India evolved into a modern nation struggling for independence.

Ancient and Classical Period (before 1200 AD)India was home to many powerful kingdoms like the Maurya Empire (under Ashoka) and the Gupta Empire. These empires were known for strong administration, law, and cultural achievements. Local self-rule (Panchayati Raj) was common in villages.

Medieval Period (1206 - 1526)This era saw the rise of Islamic rule, starting with the Delhi Sultanate. Several dynasties ruled India, including the Mamluks, Khiljis, Tughlaqs, and Lodhis. They established centralized control and introduced Persian culture and architecture.

Mughal Empire (1526 - 1707)Founded by Babur, the Mughal Empire reached its height under Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. The empire had a strong centralized administration and revenue system. Akbar promoted religious tolerance and secular governance.The British built roads, railways, and ports, but mainly to serve their commercial and military interests. These developments did not benefit ordinary Indians. Education, health, and industry received very little investment. Indian villages lacked schools, hospitals, and clean water. The infrastructure was designed to extract resources.</p>

  <b>Indian History for UPSC: ECONOMIC IMPACT OF BRITISH RULE ON INDIA</b> Deindustrialization of Indian EconomyTraditional industries, especially textiles, were destroyed due to unfair trade policies. British manufactured goods were imported duty-free, while Indian products faced heavy taxation, leading to the collapse of Indian handicrafts and artisanship.

Drain of WealthThe British extracted a huge amount of wealth from India in the form of taxes, profits, salaries, and pensions. This concept, highlighted by Dadabhai Naoroji, showed how Indian resources enriched Britain while leaving India impoverished.

Agrarian DistressLand revenue systems like Zamindari and Ryotwari were exploitative. Farmers were forced to grow cash crops like indigo and cotton, often at the expense of food crops. This led to frequent famines and rural poverty.

Lack of IndustrializationThe British discouraged industrial growth in India to avoid competition with British industries. Investment in Indian manufacturing was minimal, and modern industries remained underdeveloped until late in the colonial period.

Commercialization of AgricultureAgriculture became more market-oriented but not in favor of Indian farmers. Profits went to landlords, middlemen, or British trading companies. Farmers became dependent on fluctuating market prices and suffered during crop failures.These impacts were not accidental but the result of deliberate colonial policies.
Understanding them is essential to grasp Indiaâ€™s post-independence economic challenges and reforms.
