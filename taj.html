            <h1>Taj Mahal</h1>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, on the southern bank of the Yamuna River. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth. Shah Jahan himself is also buried within the mausoleum.

The mausoleum is the central structure of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex that includes a mosque, a guest house, formal gardens, and is surrounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was largely finished by 1648, with the entire complex completed in 1653, involving around 20,000 artisans under the guidance of the architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The Taj Mahal is widely recognized as the finest example of Mughal architecture, blending Indian, Persian, and Islamic design elements.

Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, the Taj Mahal is regarded as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the worldâ€™s heritage". It receives about 8 million visitors each year and is considered a symbol of both architectural brilliance and eternal love.

Key features of the complex include the white marble mausoleum with a large central dome, four minarets leaning slightly outward for structural safety, intricate inlays with semi-precious stones, calligraphic art, and extensive gardens. The site also has subsidiary tombs and a "moonlight garden" located to the north of the river.

Important note: The Taj Mahal is not just a single building but an integrated complex representing the highest achievements of Indo-Islamic architecture, and it stands as one of the most iconic monuments in the world.
