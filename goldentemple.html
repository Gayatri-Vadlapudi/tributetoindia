            <h1>The Golden Temple</h1>
            <p>
         The Golden Temple, officially known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, is the holiest site of Sikhism and is located in Amritsar, Punjab, India. Built at a lower level so devotees descend to enter, its design intentionally symbolizes humility and equality, further reflected by the four entrances that welcome people from all directions and backgrounds. The main construction was initiated by Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, and completed in 1604, when the Adi Granth—the sacred scripture of Sikhism—was installed inside, establishing its spiritual importance. Architecturally, the two-story shrine stands in the middle of the sacred Amrit Sarovar (pool of nectar) and combines elements from both Indo-Islamic Mughal and Hindu Rajput styles, seen in the marble lower level, gold-covered upper story, intricately gilded dome, chhatris (domed pavilions), and elaborate mural art. Over the centuries, the temple has been destroyed and rebuilt several times, most notably refurbished with gold by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the 19th century, giving it its iconic appearance.
