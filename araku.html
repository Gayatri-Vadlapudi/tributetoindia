            <h1>Araku Valley</h1>
        <p>
         Araku Valley is a picturesque hill station located in the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh, about 111–115 kilometers from Visakhapatnam and close to the Odisha border. Framed by tall mountain peaks and lush coffee plantations, Araku is renowned for its serene beauty, pleasant climate, and dense green surroundings, making it an ideal escape for relaxation and adventure.
         The valley sits at an altitude of around 900–1300 meters (2,950–4,300 feet) above sea level and stretches across nearly 36 kilometers. It is often called the Ooty of Andhra or Andhra Kashmir due to its misty valleys, sparkling waterfalls, rolling hills, and expansive biodiversity.Araku is unique for its vibrant tribal culture, represented by dozens of indigenous communities whose traditions are visible in their dances, handicrafts, art, and local food. The area is also celebrated for being one of India's few regions where tribal communities produce organic coffee on a global scale.
         Popular attractions in Araku include the ancient Borra Caves, the beautiful Padmapuram Botanical Gardens, and several cascades like Sangda and Dumbriguda waterfalls, all of which contribute to its growing reputation as a tranquil yet stimulating travel destination. The valley is accessible by both scenic roadways and a famed train route that offers stunning views of verdant hills, tunnels, and bridges.
